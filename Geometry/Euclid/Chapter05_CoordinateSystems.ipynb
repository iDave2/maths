    "# Chapter 5 - Coordinate Systems in General\n",
    "\n",
    "The major distinction between [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry) and the later *Cartesian* or [Analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry) of RenÃ© Descartes is that the latter makes far greater use of number properties to establish geometric statements; it is the study of geometry using a *coordinate system*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces coordinate systems, moving from one to two dimensions.  It would be interesting to research and compare this Descartes' actual writing, to \"get inside his head\" back then, a project left to the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 1 - Points & Real Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "> The points of a line can be placed in a correspondence with the real numbers in such a way that,\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. to every point of the line there corresponds exactly one real number;\n",
    "> 2. to every real number there corresponds exactly one point of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - One Dimensional Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "> A correspondence of the sort described in Postulate 1 is called a **one dimensional coordinate system**.  The number corresponding to a given point is called the **coordinate** of the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 2 - Restatement of Axiom 1\n",
    "\n",
    "> For every two points there is exactly one line that contains both points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Euclid's [Axiom #1](Chapter02_HistoricalGeometry.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 3 - Axis Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given two points $P$ and $Q$ of a line, the coordinate system can be chosen in such a way that the coordinate of $P$ is zero and the coordinate of $Q$ is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, coordinates may be adjusted to simplify problem solution and this is not considered cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Parallel Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two lines in a plane are **parallel** if and only if they have no points in common; that is, iff they do not intersect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Class of Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **class of lines** is the set of all lines in a plane parallel to a given line in the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Two Dimensional Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be a pair of intersecting lines and consider the class of lines parallel to each.  The resulting network of lines determine a **two dimensional coordinate system** or **grid system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 4 - Axis Primer, Grids\n",
    "\n",
    "> If class $H$ and class $V$ are two different classes of lines, then each line of class $H$ has exactly one point in common with each line of class $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 5 - Existence of Intersecting Lines?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There exists at least one pair of intersecting lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unclear what textbook authors are drinking here but context suggests a desire to introduce two dimensional coordinate terminology like,\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Axes, Coordinates, Abscissa, Ordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a **grid system**, any two intersecting lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ may be chosen to represent the system **axes** and referred to as the **X axis** and the **Y axis** respectively.  In the same way that a single number $x$ represents a **coordinate** or point along a line in one dimension, two numbers written as $(x, y)$ represent a coordinate in two dimensions.  $x$ is called the **abscissa** and locates a point's position along the X axis.  Similarly, $y$ is called the **ordinate** and specifies an offset from $0$ along the Y axis.  The point with coordinates $(0, 0)$ (i.e., where $L_1$ and $L_2$ intersect) is called the **origin** of the system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Point Equality (2D)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two points $A = (a, b)$ and $B = (c, d)$, are **equal** if and only if $a=c$ and $b=d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Vertical Line\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **vertical line** is a set of points $\\bigl\\{ (x,y) \\bigm| x\\,\\hbox{is a constant} \\bigr\\}$ or equivalently $\\bigl\\{(x,y)\\bigm|x=h\\bigr\\}$ where $h$ is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Horizontal Line\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **horizontal line** is a set of points $\\bigl\\{ (x,y) \\bigm| y\\,\\hbox{is a constant} \\bigr\\}$ or equivalently $\\bigl\\{(x,y)\\bigm|y=g\\bigr\\}$ where $g$ is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Distance Between Points\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **distance** from $A = (x_1, y_1)$ to $B = (x_2, y_2)$ is\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$AB = \\sqrt{ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 }.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The textbook also uses the term *measure* to refer to a shortest path between two points or to the measure of an angle, a sometimes confusing abstraction of terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 5-1\n",
    "\n",
    "> If $d$ is a non-negative real number and $(a,b)$ is a specific point, then there is at least one point $(m,n)$ such that $d=\\sqrt{(m-a)^2+(n-b)^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 5-2\n",
    "\n",
    "> If two points are on a horizontal line, then the distance between them is the absolute value of the difference of their corresponding $x$ coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "These simple theorems may be heuristic, designed to encourage young students to try their hand at logical proofs."
