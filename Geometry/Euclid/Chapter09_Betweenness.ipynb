    "# Chapter 9 - Betweenness\n",

    "## Definition - Between\n",
    "\n",
    "> For three different points $A$, $B$, and $C$ on the same line, $B$ is **between** $A$ and $C$ if and only if $AB+BC=AC$.  (Recall that $AB$ is shorthand for a segment's length.)  The expression $\\Between A B C$ is used to indicate $B$ is between $A$ and $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 9-1\n",
    "\n",
    "> Between any two different points $P$ and $Q$, there is at least one other point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 9-2\n",
    "\n",
    "> For any two different points $P$ and $Q$, there is a point $R$ such that $\\Between P Q R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Line Segment\n",
    "\n",
    "> If $A$ and $B$ are different points, then the union of $A$ and $B$ with all the points between them is called a **line segment** or **segment** of the line $\\Line{AB}$.  $A$ and $B$ are called the **endpoints** of the segment.  The segment is denoted by $\\Segment{AB}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to finally define a line since it has been used since Genesis.  This becomes rather confusing, a sense of introducing abstraction late for abstraction's sake?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Segment Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **measure** of $\\Segment{AB}$ is the distance from $A$ to $B$ and is written simply as $AB$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Ray\n",
    "\n",
    "> If $A$ and $B$ are different points, then the union of $\\Segment{AB}$ with all the points $P$ such that $\\Between A B P$ is called a **ray**.  Point $A$ is the **endpoint** of the ray.  The ray is denoted by $\\Ray{AB}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Congruent Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "> Segments $\\Segment{AB}$ and $\\Segment{CD}$ are **congruent** if and only if they have the same measure; that is, iff $AB = CD$.  Congruent segments are denoted by $\\Segment{AB}\\cong\\Segment{CD}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the magic work *measure* again.  So one can speak about the measure of a segment (its length) or the measure of an angle (its degrees of arc), etc.  Point here is that congruence differs from equality and refers, or will soon refer, to a sameness of shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 9-2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "> If two congruent segments have equal slopes or no slopes, then the difference of the abscissas and ordinates of their endpoints, when taken in the same order, are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine translating a segment in the plane without rotating it.  The endpoints remain in the same location relative to segment midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Direction Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "> The real numbers $x_2-x_1$ and $y_2-y_1$ of Theorem 9-2.5 are called the **x direction number** and the **y direction number** respectively of the given line segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Midpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "> Point $P$ is a midpoint of $\\Segment{AB}$ if and only if\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. $P$ lies between $A$ and $B$ ($\\Between A P B$) and\n",
    "> 2. $AP = PB$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 9-3\n",
    "\n",
    "> If $P = (x,y)$ is the midpoint of $\\Segment{AB}$ with $A = (a,b)$ and $B = (c,d)$, then\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$ (x,y) = \\Bigl( {a+c\\over 2} , {b+d\\over 2} \\Bigr). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 9-4\n",
    "\n",
    "> (Converse of Theorem 9-3.)  If $A = (a,b)$, $B=(c,d)$, and $P$ are points such that\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$ P = \\Bigl( {a+c\\over2}, {b+d\\over2} \\Bigr), $$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> then $P$ is the midpoint of $\\Segment{AB}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Bisect\n",
    "\n",
    "> If point $P$ is the midpoint of a segment, then it is said to **bisect** the segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Bisector\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any line or segment that intersects the midpoint and is distinct from another given segment is called a **bisector** of the given segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Perpendicular Bisector\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **perpendicular bisector** of a given segment is a line or segment perpendicular to it that passes through its midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 9-5\n",
    "\n",
    "> If a point is on the perpendicular bisector of a segment, then it is equally distant (equidistant) from the endpoints of the segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 9-6\n",
    "\n",
    "> (Converse of Theorem 9-5.)  If points $A$, $B$, and $P$ are different points and $AP = PB$, then $P$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $\\Segment{AB}$."
