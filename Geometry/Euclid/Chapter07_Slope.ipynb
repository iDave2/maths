    "> Given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on a line, the **slope** of the line is defined as\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$\\cases{ (y_2-y_1)\\,/\\,(x_2-x_1)       & if $x_1 \\ne x_2$; \\cr\n",
    "          {\\rm undefined\\;(no\\;slope)}  & if $x_1 = x_2$.   \\cr}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $x_1 = x_2$, the slope is *undefined* or *infinite*.  In this textbook, a vertical line is said to have **no slope**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 7-1\n",
    "\n",
    "> In computing slopes (and in general), $${y_2-y_1\\over x_2-x_1} = {y_1-y_2\\over x_1-x_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 7-2\n",
    "\n",
    "> The slope of a line given by $Ax + By + C = 0$, when $B\\ne 0$, is $-A/B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 7-3\n",
    "\n",
    "> The slope of a line is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - X- & Y-Intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **x-intercept** of a line (or any locus) is the abscissa of any point where that locus crosses the X axis.  Similarly, the **y-intercept** of a line is the ordinate of any point where the line crosses the Y axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Conventions m, a, b\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unless stated otherwise, the slope of a line will be indicated by the letter '$m$', its x-intercept by '$a$', and its y-intercept by the letter '$b$'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 7-4\n",
    "\n",
    "> Through a given point there is exactly one line with a given slope and exactly one line with no slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter closes with a presentation of alternate representations of lines.  Different problem contexts determine which representation works best.\n",
