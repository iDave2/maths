    "## Definition - Angle, Vertex, Sides\n",
    "\n",
    "> An **angle** is the union of two rays with a common endpoint.  This common endpoint is called the **vertex**, and the two rays are called the **sides** of the angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **polygon** is a set of $n$ line segments such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The $n$ line segments intersect in exactly $n$ points;\n",
    "2. The line segments intersect only at their endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Polygon, Vertex, Sides\n",
    "\n",
    "> Each line segment of a polygon is called a **side** of the polygon and each point of intersection is called a **vertex**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **triangle** is a polygon of three sides.  The three sides (in elided picture) are $\\Segment{AB}$, $\\Segment{AC}$, and $\\Segment{BC}$, and the three vertices are $A$, $B$, and $C$.  The triangle is denoted by $\\triangle ABC$.  $\\angle ABC$, $\\angle ACB$, and $\\angle BAC$ are called the **angles** of $\\triangle ABC$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Measure of an Angle\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **measure** of an angle is the amount of rotation used to dscribe the angle's \"opening.\"  The measure is usually expressed (in this book) in **degrees**.  The symbol for degrees is '$\\Degrees$' and the measure of $\\angle ABC$ is denoted \"$m\\angle ABC$\".  For example, if $\\angle ABC$ has a measure of $30\\Degrees$, it is written $m\\angle ABC = 30\\Degrees$.  The measure of all angles will be a number $r$ such that\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$ 0\\Degrees \\le r \\le 180\\Degrees. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this convention of the textbook and keep it in quadrants I and II.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Right Angle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let two rays $\\Ray{AB}$ and $\\Ray{AC}$ form $\\angle BAC$.  $\\angle BAC$ is called a **right angle** if and only if $\\Ray{AB} \\perp \\Ray{AC}$.  The right angle is often shown in drawings by placing a small \"box\" at the right angle (as shown in the elided picture).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 6 - 90 Degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "> An angle is a right angle if and only if it has a measure of $90\\Degrees$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this a postulate or a definition?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Congruent Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two angles are **congruent** if and only if they have the same measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Zero, Acute, Obtuse Angle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let the measure of an angle be $r$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * If $r=0$, the angle is called a **zero angle** and its two sides conincide.\n",
    "> * If $0<r<90$, the angle is called an **acute** angle.\n",
    "> * If $90 < r < 180$, the angle is called an **obtuse** angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Interior of Angle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given any angle $\\angle ABC$, a point $D$ lies in the **interior** of the angle if and only if some line through $D$ intersects the sides of the angle in points $X$ and $Y$ (different from the vertex) such that $\\Between X D Y$; that is, $D$ is between $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Exterior of Angle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A point is in the **exterior** of an angle if and only if it is:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. not in the interior of the angle, and\n",
    "> 2. not on the angle itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Adjacent Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two angles are **adjacent** if and only if\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. They have the same vertex,\n",
    "> 2. They have exactly one common side, and\n",
    "> 3. The intersection of their interiors is the empty set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Straight Angle\n",
    "\n",
    "> If two adjacent angles have their non-common sides lying on a line, those two sides form a **straight angle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Interior of Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given any triangle $\\triangle ABC$, a point $D$ is in the **interior of the triangle** if and only if it is in the interior of two angles of the triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Exterior of Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A point is in the **exterior of a triangle** if and only if it is\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. not in the interior of the triangle, and\n",
    "> 2. not on the triangle itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Exterior Angle of Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "> An **exterior angle** of a triangle is an angle which is adjacent to an angle of the triangle and with it forms a straight angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 7 - Angle Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Angle Addition Postulate**:  If $D$ is a point in the interior of $\\angle ABC$, then $m\\angle ABD + m\\angle DBC = m\\angle ABC$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-1\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every angle is congruent to itself.  (Identity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-2\n",
    "\n",
    "> The measure of a straight angle is $180\\Degrees$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-3\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sum of the measures of the adjacent angles with a common vertex is $360\\Degrees$ if:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. each angle is adjacent to exactly two other angles and\n",
    "> 2. the intersection of the interiors of any two angles is the empty set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-4\n",
    "\n",
    "> All right angles are congruent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-5\n",
    "\n",
    "> The adjacent angles formed by two intersecting lines are congruent if and only if the lines are perpendicular.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Supplementary Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two angles are **supplementary** if and only if the sum of their measures is $180\\Degrees$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition - Complementary Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two angles are **complementary** if and only if the sum of their measures is $90\\Degrees$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-6\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two adjacent angles whose non-common sides lie on a line are supplementary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-7\n",
    "\n",
    "> Supplements of congruent angles are congruent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 10-8\n",
    "\n",

    "## Definition - Vertical Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two distinct intersecting lines form two pairs of non-adjacent angles.  Such pairs are called **vertical angles**.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Vertical Angle Theorem**:  Vertical angles are congruent."
